DONOR CONNECT
Donor Connect is an AI-driven web application designed to help hospitals and blood banks efficiently identify reliable and available blood donors. By leveraging a machine learning model trained on historical donor data—including number of donations, months since last donation, and email response time—the system predicts the likelihood of a donor being available at any given time. Users can upload donor datasets, search by blood group and city, and view predicted availability to make faster, more informed decisions during emergencies. Built using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, Donor Connect streamlines the donor search process and lays the foundation for future enhancements like multi-region support, automated notifications, and advanced prediction algorithms
